## Abstract
The Quantum computing paradigm shift has changed the way we look at data security these days, especially the long-term security of data. Soon, the fast algorithms will be designed to run on quantum computers which can break some of the most widely used cryptosystems, making them vulnerable. However, to address this issue, Chaos theory is actively being studied as a basis for post-quantum era cryptosystems and advancement has been made in the domain of study. The unique characteristic of chaotic systems can be leveraged to produce highly secure cryptographic systems. In our talk, we will present a logic locking-based chaotic encryption system, and we also demonstrate the data encryption and decryption mechanism.

- Challenges in implementing post-quantum era cryptography
- Understand chaotic encryption
- Learn to design a logic locking-based secure cryptographic system
